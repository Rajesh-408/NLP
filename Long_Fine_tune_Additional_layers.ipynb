In this way, this credential is similar to many other credentials in a wide variety of fields.

They consider a fair market price of what the asset could have been sold for on the day it was lost, stolen, or destroyed. This typically comes out to a lower amount than the policyholder originally paid for the asset because assets lose value over time due to depreciation and wear and tear.For example, if a policyholder wrecks their 2011 car and the insurance policy covers the actual cash value, the insurance company would pay the amount equal to the car's worth at the time of the accident, which is determined by subtracting factors like depreciation from the replacement cost. This differs from replacement-cost system, which would pay the insured enough to buy a new, replacement asset.\",\n",

Therefore, be sure to read the terms and details carefully. For instance, the rider may stipulate that death must occur within a certain time after an accident or that the policyholder must lose both sets of limbs or eyesight in both eyes to qualify for the full benefit.',\n",

APR is an annual rate of funds charged as a percentage that represents the annual cost of the funds borrowed over the life of the loan.By law, banks and financial institutions need to show customers the annual percentage rate to ensure a clear understanding of the interest rates applicable to their loans and credit agreements. For borrowers, APR is one of the essential parameters used for comparing interest and fees from various lenders. The APR enables borrowers to evaluate the cost of the loan in terms of a percentage. For instance, if banks charge 1% interest per month, the APR amounts to 1% x 12 months = 12%. In mortgages, the APR could include interest charges, closing costs or other payments needed for getting the loan approved. With credit cards, APR usually only includes the interest charges.

In other words, rather than adjusting claims themselves, they simply outsource this process to the adjustment bureau.Insurance companies must pay to use the services of an adjustment bureau. Once they become a client, the adjustment bureau will do things for them like determine exactly how much coverage each claim will get and help policyholders through the process of filing their claims. While many insurance companies have their own claims departments that do this type of work, others simply find it easier to let an adjustment bureau handle it.',\n",

These changes can include adjusting premium amounts, altering coverage periods, or changing premium payment periods. Adjustment provisions are commonly used in life insurance policies but can also be used in other forms of insurance.Adjustment provisions are commonly used in life insurance policies because their coverage often extends for many years or even decades. It allows the policy to be adjusted to accommodate the numerous changes in financial and life circumstances that the policyholder is likely to experience during that time. This provision is appealing to many who seek to obtain life insurance coverage because life insurance tends to be held over a very long time period.',\n",

This bond guarantees that the assets are distributed fairly to the beneficiaries, creditors, and other parties that are financially linked to the deceased.The distribution of the assets of a deceased person is made simple when the they have left behind a will. The estate also usually has an executor tasked with interpreting the will. In the absence of both a will and an executor, the court appoints an administrator through a probate procedure.',\n",

These administrative activities can include such activities as record keeping, data filing, and so on.Without administrative charges, insurers would have to dip into premium profits to pay its employees who take care of various administrative tasks. Therefore, they simply require clients to pay administrative charges, which are typically billed on a quarterly or annual basis, for policies like group employee benefit plans. This helps the insurer maintain these policies without necessarily relying on premiums.',\n",

In the context of insurance, insurance companies commonly have a number of administrative expenses, such as rent, utilities, certain salaries, and anything else not directly involved with underwriting or marketing.It is important for insurance companies to closely watch their administrative expenses because although they do not factor into sales or production, they can still add up and must be accounted for. Expenses like employee benefits, security, and cleaning services may also be classified as administrative expenses. Like other types of business expenses, such as selling and production expenses, they are typically covered by the income the insurance company generates from premiums.

This differs from non-admitted insurance, which is insurance provided by companies that have not been licensed or approved by a state Department of Insurance.Admitted insurance generally tends to be more reliable and secure for a few reasons. First, admitted insurance companies have already been evaluated by the state to make sure they are sound. Second, state departments of insurance will pay out claims for admitted insurers in the event that they fail. Third, policyholders with admitted insurance can file claims with state departments of insurance if they have a grievance about how a claim was handled',\n",

       " 'Adverse selection, in the context of insurance, occurs when an insurance company accepts only applicants who they believe will incur a low probability of loss. Consequently, there is adverse selection when buyers become more eager to purchase an insurance policy in the belief that they highly need to make a claim.Adverse selection has a negative effect in the insurance business because the parties to the contract tend not to gain equal benefits. To resolve this issue, insurance companies offer premiums proportional to the risk based on the person’s condition. For example, a person who smokes will have higher health and life insurance premiums than a non-smoker. Similarly, a person who has been convicted guilty of DUI would have to pay higher premiums than a person without a record of drunk driving.',\n",

This can happen if a false claim is made or if another company feels that the ad has infringed upon a copyright, etc. Whatever the case may be, advertisements sometimes result in lawsuits.

In addition, companies may also be considered affiliated if they are both owned by a parent company. Furthermore, a loose usage of the term may refer to companies that are related to each other. In terms of insurance, insurance companies may be affiliated through interlocking directorates or common ownership.In contrast, a subsidiary would refer to a company that the parent company owns more than 50%. Nevertheless, in this way, two subsidiaries may be considered affiliated companies as well.

In the context of insurance, insurance agencies sell policies on behalf of insurance carriers. The former has permission to find customers and write policies. For this service, the agency receives a fee from the carrier.Agencies essentially act as middlemen between insurance companies and potential customers. They benefit both the insurance company and potential customers due to their specialization in finding potential customers policies that best fit their needs.

Unlike captive insurance agents, many insurance agents are independent, and may sell insurance for a number of different insurance companies, instead of just one.

This helps the policyholders save time. Because agents of record have the legal authority to act on behalf of the client, insurance companies can deal directly with them. However, insurance companies usually will not deal with other people who are not authorized agents of record for the initial insured party.

In other words, if a policyholder files several claims or one large claim, they must pay out of pocket up to a certain dollar sum. Subsequently, coverage kicks in, and the insurer starts making payments.As a general rule of thumb, the higher the policyholder’s deductible, the lower the cost of premiums for the insured. In essence, an aggregate annual deductible puts a cap on how much a policyholder must pay out on claims over the course of the policy period. In this way, the insured need not pay a deductible for each individual claim. This is especially valuable in product liability cases.',\n",

Without such limits, insurance companies would likely have trouble remaining financially solvent due to having too many obligations. Aggregate limits help insurers keep their obligations in line with their ability to pay them while still making a profit. If a person files claims in a policy year that exceed the aggregate limit, then they would have to pay out of pocket for the excess amount.',\n",

The insurance company requires it so that once it covers a risk, it becomes the legal basis for determining the amount of money to be released for coverage. Thus, the insured can no longer contest the amount of coverage.

       " 'Amount at risk refers to the amount of money that a life insurance company will have to pay out in death benefits if a policyholder dies, after the cash value has been taken out. This value is typically calculated by subtracting the accumulated cash value of the policy from the total death benefit that the policy offers to the policyholder.Many life insurance policies accumulate cash value as time goes on. This is because money from the premiums is often invested in order to grow the policy value. However, oftentimes, the cash value of the policy does not grow large enough to surpass the death benefits owed by the insurer in the event of the death of the policyholder. So, the insurer will still be responsible for paying out whatever money is owed after the cash value has been given to beneficiaries. This amount is the amount at risk. So, for example, if the cash value of a life insurance policy is $50,000, and if the death benefit is $200,000, then the amount at risk is $150,000.',\n",

For example, if your homeowner's insurance policy has a limit of $300,000, then the amount of insurance you have for this policy would be $300,000. You are responsible for losses over this limit.Insurance policies that have a higher amount of insurance generally tend to cost more. However, these policies also tend to provide more coverage for their policyholders than the cheaper alternatives. How much insurance a person needs depends on their individual circumstances. Many people, for instance, will purchase the state minimum amount of auto insurance. However, those who drive a lot, or who believe they are more prone to accidents, may choose an auto policy with a higher amount of insurance.\",\n",

These additions to the health plan are often the following: vision care, dental care, and life insurance. The employer can subsidize this plan might ask the employers to contribute to it. These benefits are then added to an already existing group health insurance.The health of the employees impacts their performance. That explains why employers provide health insurance. Once an employer gets sick, health care is given to him or her through insurance so that he or she can recuperate and join the workforce again.

Once covered expenses reach the annual aggregate, the policy stops paying out benefits, even if subsequent legitimate claims are filed. In many cases, it is the same as the aggregate limit as many policies only last for a year.Insurance companies often include annual aggregate limits in their policies because it would simply cost them too much money to not limit coverage. For example, a car insurance policy may have an aggregate limit of $50,000 a year. This limit provides a solid amount of coverage without the insurance company having to pledge to providing too much. But without a limit, an insurer may have to pay out much more than $50,000 to cover an unfortunate driver who incurs many covered expenses for repairs or liability issues over a policy year.',\n",

This can be quite convenient when compared to making twelve payments for a monthly plan for the same length of time.

APR is an annual rate of funds charged as a percentage that represents the annual cost of the funds borrowed over the life of the loan.By law, banks and financial institutions need to show customers the annual percentage rate to ensure a clear understanding of the interest rates applicable to their loans and credit agreements. For borrowers, APR is one of the essential parameters used for comparing interest and fees from various lenders. The APR enables borrowers to evaluate the cost of the loan in terms of a percentage. For instance, if banks charge 1% interest per month, the APR amounts to 1% x 12 months = 12%. In mortgages, the APR could include interest charges, closing costs or other payments needed for getting the loan approved. With credit cards, APR usually only includes the interest charges.

Annual reports are distributed to shareholders of a corporation, typically at an annual shareholder's meeting. In the context of insurance, insurance companies often provide annual reports to their shareholders. This helps the shareholders evaluate the yearly progress for the company.Annual reports not only provide shareholders with important financial information, but they also provide it to the government and to the public. The government's interest in the information is primarily for regulatory purposes.

In such cases, the policyholder pays into the annuity and is usually the annuitant once the annuity matures and it is time to receive the regular payments.Annuities offer individuals a way to plan for retirement and secure a fixed income source. Usually, the annuitant is the owner of the annuity, and many companies require this to be the case. However, some life insurance annuities have options to keep paying the annuities to a different beneficiary after the initial policyholder dies. Such annuities are a way for the policyholder to ensure the money they paid into the annuity does not go to waste upon their death and can benefit a loved one designated as a beneficiary. These types of annuities can supplement death benefits from the primary life insurance policy.',\n",

During the accumulation stage, all the money stays in the annuity contract, and the investor does not receive any money. At any point, the investor can decide to receive payments, which is known as the payout stage. Annuitization converts the annuity from the accumulation stage to the payout stage.The annuity owner has a number of different options to set up payments. For example, they can choose the number of years they want to receive payments and the number of payments they want to receive throughout a year. They can even choose to receive all the money all at once as one lump sum. However, once an investor decides on annuitization, they generally cannot reverse the process to having an annuity in the accumulation stage.

The first options allows the annuitant to collect monthly payouts, which are divided up according to the annuitant's life expectancy. The second option provides the annuitant with a single payment for the total amount they are entitled to collect. This latter option is usually chosen if they need the funds for an emergency or want to invest it elsewhere.\",\n",

Although the life annuity allows the annuitant to receive payments until their death, there is a risk that they will die relatively young and, therefore, not get a substantial return on their initial investment.

This is why many people chose to purchase them as a part of a life insurance policy. How they work is that the policyholder makes a payment at every interval for a certain amount of time.

If a surgeon, caligrapher, or concert pianist injures their hand, they will no longer be able to practice their own occupation. The injury, however, will not prevent them from taking on some other occupation. They could, for instance, work as a parking attendant, a door-to-door salesperson, or a receptionist.

This is called \"making bail.\" If the defendant shows up for trial, then he or she gets the money back. He or she can then use that money to repay the bail bondsman. In the context of insurance, bail bond companies must have commercial insurance to legally operate due to the risks associated with the business.Bail bond companies are required to have insurance from a \"surety company\" because the bail business can be very risky. The reason is because many defendants do not show up for their trials. When this happens, the government keeps the bail money. This means the bail bond company can lose money. However, many bail bond companies require collateral from defendants in order to give them bonds. Between collateral and commercial insurance from surety companies, bail bond companies can be well equipped to handle the risks associated with the business.',\n",

Over the course of their coverage, they might need to make significant changes to their beneficiaries listed. Imagine, for example, that a man names his wife as a beneficiary to his life insurance policy. If they subsequently get divorced, there is a good chance he will want to remove her as one of the beneficiaries to the policy.

However, trusts and life insurance policies can be taxed differently. For example, if the beneficiary of a life insurance policy is not the policyholder's spouse, or if the estate is worth more than $2,000,000, then different tax laws may apply on the death benefits. However, irrevocable life insurance trusts are often not subject to the same tax rules.

Whether or not a loss is covered is determined by the terms of the specific policy that the policyholder bought from the insurer.Different types of insurance provide benefits for different types of losses. For example, health insurance provides benefits for losses related to medical treatment when one experiences a health problem. Life insurance provides benefits for the death of the policyholder to his or her named beneficiaries. Business insurance provides benefits for losses related to a business.

Benefit years are commonly used in health insurance and in unemployment insurance. For unemployment insurance, the benefit year typically begins on the date that the claim is filed.Receiving unemployment benefits during a benefit year can be a crucial source of income for people who become unemployed. However, it is very important for people who are receiving unemployment benefits to try to find a new source of income during the benefit year.

In this case, because the 20 percent coinsurance, or $5,000, exceeds the limit, the insured would only pay $3,000 in coinsurance as well as $2,000 as a deductible, with the insurer covering the remaining $20,000. For future expenses in the policy year, because the insured has already reached their coinsurance limit and paid their deductible, the insurer would cover 100%.',\n",

This usually happens when the worth of the insurance bought is less than the worth of property covered.The formula for getting the claim in a property insurance is the actual amount of insurance divided by required amount of insurance (based on the worth of the property during the loss) and then multiplied by the amount of loss. So, if the amount paid is less than the required amount, the insurer will not be able to cover the amount of the loss. Suppose that Mr. X paid the $60,000 for a property valued at $90,000 which now needs $30,000 for repairs because of a specific peril listed in the policy.Given the computation, the insurance company would give Mr. X only $20,000.

That responsibility is a portion of the death benefit. Once a claim is made, the reinsurer gives the fixed amount to the insurance company. The company then gives that amount to the beneficiary.Reinsurance is the way that insurance companies can also insure themselves.

This is important to note when buying an insurance because an insurance company appraises the worth of a property at the time of a loss (and not during the insurance purchase) and matches it with the coinsurance requirement paid. If the amount paid by the insured is less than the required percentage needed which is derived from the worth of the property during the loss, he or she ends up paying out of his or her pocket for a fraction of the loss which the insurance will not cover.',\n",

The ratio, typically in percentage form, depicts the level of performance during a period. It is computed by dividing the total of the company's losses and expenses by the earned premiums.If the combined ratio after policyholder dividends is below 100% , it indicates that the company is already making some underwriting profit, while any ratio above 100% implies that the company is paying more money in claims than the premiums it receives. Nevertheless, it is still possible for a company with a ratio above 100% to still make an overall profit as the combined ratio does not reflect income from investments. Due to the latter, some also consider the combined ratio a good way to measure a company's performance.\",\n",

Whether there is property damage, injury to other persons, and so on, the single limit applies to the entire claim payout. This is commonly seen in property insurance.In contract, split limit coverage specifies different maximum amounts awarded to different components of an insurance claim. For example, a combined single limit policy might have a limit of $300,000 per claim, but a split limit policy might max out at $80,000 per person for bodily injuries, $50,000 for property damage, and a maximum of $300,000 per claim. This means an insured individual who files a claim for $200,000 in damages due to injuries would receive $200,000 from the combined limit policy, but only $80,000 from the split limit policy. Therefore, the former provides more coverage overall and therefore tends to cost more. To supplement a split or combined limit policy, an umbrella policy may be a wise choice to protect against costly risks.',\n",

This insurance is more expensive than the standard car insurance.A business that requires a vehicle for its operations needs commercial auto insurance rather than the standard motorist policy, even though the premiums are higher.

In this way, the surety acts as an insurer.Commercial bonds are basically a form of insurance that hedges against losses caused by unqualified business people or by qualified business people who don't follow the law. For example, a contractor may find that a client files a claim against him for allegedly not following proper contracting laws.

A point of service plan, which is the most popular, lets policyholders choose a primary care physician (PCP) from a list the insurer provides. If a policyholder sees a doctor outside this network, they typically receive lower benefits for covered services. Another model is the health maintenance organization (HMO) plan. Similarly, it allows policyholders to choose PCP from an insurer established network of healthcare professionals. However, it generally does not pay for covered services received outside the network.

However, many standard commercial property polices only provide coverage for a fixed structure and its contents. This is why companies who have movable property need commercial property floaters. If this type of insurance did not exist, then circuses and other companies who constantly move their property wouldn't be able to travel around without being exposed to substantial risks.

This database lets insurance companies know what types of claims may have been filed in the past for a specific property. This information helps them to underwrite insurance policies for the property for new property owners.CLUE reports are extremely helpful for insurance companies when it comes to understanding risk. This is because CLUE reports can let an insurance company know whether a particular property has a history of water damage, theft, structural damage, etc. All of these things can be factored into the ultimate cost of premiums for a property insurance policy when the insurance company underwrites the policy for the new property owners. For this reason, many property insurers look at CLUE reports before generating insurance policies.',\n",

High sum assurance is when a CMM policy covers a major portion of hospitalization charges; pre-admission diagnosis includes laboratory examinations, diagnosis and x-rays, and the insured will only be reimbursed if they are hospitalized for treatment; outpatient expenses includes reimbursement for any outpatient expenses for kidney dialysis or cancer treatment; non-social medical treatment includes medicinal drugs not covered by the socialized health care system; ambulance fees include transportation fees incurred due to illness; and a no claim bonus refers to the annual limit increase an insured may receive in the renewal if they do not file a claim.',\n",

It does not cover basic, primary health care; rather, it covers the gap between what primary Medicare insurance pays for and what the policyholder would pay out of pocket. It does not cover long-term care, hearing aids, vision or dental care, eyeglasses, or private nurses.Medicare supplements were first introduced in 1949. From the term supplement, this type of insurance is designed to work with existing Medicare insurances. During times wherein primary Medicare insurance proves to be insufficient, a comprehensive medical supplement may come in handy. It can help pay for co-payments, coinsurance, and deductibles primary Medicare won't cover. Additional expenses like a visit to the doctor's or hospital stays become deductibles that a Medicare supplement policy would cover. These insurance plans are helpful but are not designed to serve as a replacement for primary Medicare plans.\",\n",

An example of a bodily injury that comprehensive personal liability coverage could protect against would be a guest at the house tripping and falling down the policyholder's stairs.

This is a good idea especially among individuals who believe that they are at risk to perils that cannot be covered by a single policy. Buying concurrent policies is a prudent decision if the cost of such insurance is not prohibitive.The challenge with concurrent insurance is that it is difficult to determine which insurance policy will pay for the losses as both have the same risk exposure and coverage. The insurers will avoid claim responsibilities to policies that they did not underwrite. In most cases, the issue is taken to court and the court will be the one to determine who pays for the insurance through a process called apportionment. It is important to note that concurrent insurance policy contracts should include clauses that outline the framework that it will provide apportioning coverage. For instance, the policy may only provide coverage in excess of the coverage provided by other policies.',\n",

In addition, the condo association's master policy plays a major role in determining the minimal amount of coverage a condo owner may want to purchase. Some master policies only cover common areas and the exterior building, while others may include items besides personal property in individual units.

There are also cost plus health insurance plans available as a supplement to basic plans.The main benefit of cost plus models is in their transparency. The vendor has an accurate idea of their profit margin and need not worry about expenses taking away from it, and the purchaser has a better idea of the exact cost of a service without needing to worry about fraudulent, marked up, or duplicate charges. In terms of health insurance, cost plus models may represent a much fairer and simpler way to handle medical billing so that all parties, i.e., the patient, health care provider, and insurer, can benefit from a model that does not favor one party over another.',\n",

Different from premiums, these charges are billed to pay for administration, mortality and other responsibilities of the insurer. The amount is largely determined by the risk class and age of the policyholder.Cost of insurance charges tend to increase as a life insurance policyholder gets older. This is largely because as the policyholder ages, the more likely they are to die and thereby require the insurer to pay out a death benefit.',\n",

Not equivalent to a certificate of insurance or other policy documents, it typically lists the insured, insurer, and the coverage.An insurer issues a cover note as proof of coverage while they continue processing the paperwork to finalize the policy. During this interim period, it can serve as evidence the insured purchase insurance and offers the same coverage as the actual policy though some restrictions may apply. In the event it expires before official documents have been issued, the insurer will issue an extension, or the insurer may need to request one.

For example, a life insurance policy that provides $500,000 coverage would award the beneficiary the death benefit of $500,000 if the insured passed away. With automobile insurance, $5,000 worth of coverage may represent the current value of the car upon its acceptance for coverage by the insurer. This means that if the car has theft coverage, and it is stolen, the insured owner shall receive $5,000 as replacement value for the car.

If a policyholder attempts to file a claim for a hazard that is not covered, then they will not be reimbursed, generally.It is important for policyholders to know exactly which hazards they have coverage for. The reason is because some common hazards may not be covered, even if they expect them to be. For example, earthquakes are hazards that are often not covered on many homeowner's policies.

For example, a homeowner's insurance policy may not cover losses due to an act of God, such as a tornado. In such a case, losses incurred from tornado damage would not be considered covered losses. Thus the insurance company would provide no financial reimbursement for losses caused by tornadoes.

These scores are based on the credit history of the potential policyholders. The reason why insurers often use credit based insurance scores is because poor credit is often associated with a higher likelihood of filing insurance claims.Credit based insurance scores are commonly used by auto insurers and by insurance companies that issue homeowner's policies. People with better credit are perceived to be more responsible and less risky. So, a higher credit based insurance score can often help a person get approved for insurance or even get a lower rate.

In the context of insurance, auto insurance companies commonly use credit scores based of of credit reports as one metric for evaluating risk and for pricing premiums.Credit reports are based on how much debt a person has, and how well he or she has been able to pay his or her bills. Credit scores, which are based on credit reports, provide a score from 300-800. The higher the credit score, and the closer it is to 800, the more the more creditworthy the person is deemed to be. This can reflect a lower risk for auto insurance companies. The reason is because many auto insurance companies believe that people with higher credit scores are less likely to cause auto accidents. So, the better the credit report, and resulting credit score, the lower one's auto insurance premiums may be.\",\n",

Lenders use credit risk to assess whether or not a particular borrower appears to be a reliable investment. The higher the credit risk, the higher the interest rate that lenders charge on their loans. Higher interest rates help to decrease a risk of losing money on the loan. In the context of insurance, a lender can purchase various types of insurance to decrease their risk in the market.If lenders did not calculate credit risk, then they would not be able to determine which borrower may be a safe investment, and which borrower may be a poor investment. This could result in banks and other lenders losing a lot of money from taking bad risks. To prevent this, lenders check credit risk to screen potential loan candidates. The better a person's credit score and the steadier their income is, the higher the chance that they would be a low credit risk. This can dramatically improve the person's odds of qualifying for a loan.\",\n",

Ordinarily, under a new health plan, pre-existing health conditions (conditions for which treatment is sought within six months prior to enrollment), are excluded from the coverage within a year. Under a new law, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), if you applied for new coverage within 63 days of having previous coverage, the new plan cannot impose the exclusion. In other words, to offset the exclusion, the period of lapsed coverage must not be more than 63 days between the policies.For example, John transfers to another company that offered better career opportunities and benefits. Six weeks after his resignation, he started his new position, which entitled him to a similar health benefit that covered his entire family.

However, this cost is usually only covered if a covered peril causes the debris.Debris can accumulate on a property for a number of reasons. For example, a house could burn down, causing the buildup of charred wood debris, or a tree could fall down on a property, or a hurricane could knock parts of a house off, and so on. Insurance companies recognize that the removal of debris can represent a financial burden, not to mention the cost of the repairs to the property.

The debris, however, must be caused by a loss specifically covered in the policy. Oftentimes, these clauses only cover losses 5 to 10 percent of the full policy value.Many types of debris might accrue on a property. For example, if a tree falls on the property, the resulting debris would include wood, leaves, and broken structural components of the building. If a fire starts in a building, it may result in charred furniture and other housing materials. The cost of removing this debris is usually separate from the cost to repair the property.

An insurance company commonly declines an insurance application if the business or the person applying represents too high of a risk for the insurance company to pay out too much money. Each insurer measures risk based on company and specific standards in the field.Since an insurance company prefers to have policyholders that represent lower risks, they tend to decline insurance applications from entities that represent higher risks and chances of claims. The decline of request for insurance coverage depends on the standards of an insurance company, so one insured declining an application does not mean all other insurers will decline it as well.

Premiums normally remain the same throughout the life of the policy, which can range from one to 30 years. The decrease in the death benefit may occur monthly or annually.The majority of decreasing term life insurance comes in the form of mortgage life insurance. On the one hand, lenders are secured as they will still receive payment even if the borrower-insured passes, and on the other, the family or beneficiaries of the insured are spared from getting in financial trouble due to unpaid debts or being evicted from the property due to an unpaid mortgage.

If an insured has a loss, they need to pay up to their deductible limit first before their insurance policy will cover the rest of the damages.For example, if an insured has a car insurance policy with a $2,000 deductible, they would need to pay for the first $2,000 of any repairs themselves after an accident before their insurance would pay for anything.

Usually, deductibles only represent a small fraction of the annual aggregate limit that an insurer will pay for a policy. For example, a health insurance policy may have a deductible clause of $4,000, and the annual aggregate limit of the policy for the insurer may be $100,000.

In simpler terms, the former refers to covering damages upon judgement against the insured, and the latter refers to paying for defense costs. Once a third party files a lawsuit against the insured, it would trigger the duty to defend; however, in cases wherein the insurer determines that the liability in the lawsuit would not be covered by the policy, they could refuse to fulfill their duty to defend. In such a case, a policyholder would have to pay for defense costs, which can become very expensive, out of pocket. This is where a defense of suit against insured clause would benefit a policyholder as this provision fortifies the insurer's duty to defend across a larger range of lawsuits. Even if the policy might not cover the liability in question or the lawsuit seems to be without foundation, the insurer would pay for the defense costs.\",\n",

With defined contribution plans, employers allow their employees to receive benefits based on a contribution made by the company at certain periods.

However, problems can arise if the investments perform poorly. This is especially true if the stock market experiences a crash or a strong recession. Due to the way that defined contribution pension plans are structured, the employee typically controls the investments. So, the responsibility for the success of the investments falls on the employee and not the pension provider. Many companies see this as an advantage of defined contribution pension plans.

Without disability buy-out insurance, the other co-owners might not be able to buy out the departing partner's share, and thus, a third party might be able to buy it and subsequently have a major stake in the company. However, if they have the proper coverage, they could use the benefit to purchase the $20 million share.\",\n",
       " 'A disability clause is a provision in a life insurance policy that offers certain benefits to the insured in case they become disabled. It may include a waiver of premium and a monthly disability income, but the exact benefits depend on the clause.Disability clauses are necessary in life insurance policies because policyholders sometimes become disabled. They benefit both the policyholder and the insurer because the policyholder does not want to lose coverage, and the insurer does not want to lose a client. Moreover, as they require a higher premium payment, the insurer stands to make a profit on policyholders who never become disabled and claim their benefits. Nevertheless, the many benefit options can help policyholders tailor their life insurance policy to meet their specific needs and risk such that their money does not necessarily go to waste.',\n",

In other words, it is money people who become disabled receive either from the Social Security Administration or a private insurance company. The purpose of disability income is to provide disabled people a means to live by supplementing their finances with a portion of the income they would be earning if they were fully healthy.Serious disabilities can prevent a person from earning an income. In such cases, disabled people could quickly go bankrupt if they do not have some sort of insurance coverage. For example, a construction worker would not be able to work on a construction site if he has been temporarily paralyzed. Some disabilities are temporary, and some are permanent.

This benefit only kicks in when a person becomes disabled and can no longer work in the manner that they were doing before. There are both public and private options for disability income insurance.Disability income insurance exists to serve as a hedge against complete lack of income in the event a person becomes disabled. Some injuries, such as a broken spine, an amputated limb, traumatic brain injury, and so on, may be permanently disabling. Individuals who get these types of disabilities may need disability income insurance in perpetuity. For injuries that occur on the job site or as a result of work-related tasks, individuals may also be able to receive workers' compensation benefits.\",\n",

Depending on the particular rider, the policyholder may also receive monthly income payments at a rate of 1 percent of the full value of the policy.The benefit of a disability income rider is that it allows a person with a life insurance policy to continue to receive coverage even if they can no longer pay the premiums due to a loss of income because of a disability. This means the beneficiary would still receive a death benefit, and for qualifying policies, cash value would continue to grow, and dividends would still be paid out.',\n",

If such a scenario occurs, the insurance company gives an amount to the business partner who needs it to buy out the shares of the one suffering from a disability or a crippling disease.It is more likely that a business partner will suffer from disability than die before his or her retirement. If this happens, this becomes a problem to the other partner. The business will still provide income to the one who is disabled even if the latter can no longer do his or her share of the work because of his or her condition. That is where buy and sell insurance for disability helps. With a policy like this, an insurance company provides money for the healthy partner to buy the shares of the one who is disabled instead of taking a bank loan for the buy-out, which will just place the business in debt. It is a win-win situation for both the one afflicted with the disability and the healthy partner. The first gets the money equal to his shares. The second proceeds with making new business decisions without experiencing financial stress.\",\n",

In some car insurance policies, this option is offered as an incentive for drivers with a good driving record. In these cases, the insured lowers their deductible every year that they drive without accident.

The engineer submits their evaluation to the company and this evaluation will serve as a basis for recommendation and the price of the premium.

       " \"An expected loss is the sum of the values of all losses a company is statistically likely to incur. In general, expected losses are losses that are predicted to arise from loans or from a portfolio of assets with fluctuating or depreciating values.An insurance company can calculate their expected loss by comparing their projected number of claims and the estimated value of those claims to the premiums they anticipate earning over the same period of time. The result of the comparison is the insurer's expected loss ratio.\",\n",
       " \"An expected loss ratio is a way of determining how much money earned from premiums an insurer should set aside to pay for future claims. The amount is not fixed, but based on probability and actuarial forecasts that attempt to predict the number and severity of claims the insurer will have to pay.The premiums charged by an insurance company are mostly based on projected future claims (along with operating expenses and profit). Thus, a portion of the paid premium goes to a reserve that ensures the insurer can pay a claim. As a method for calculating future claims, expected loss ratio is often used for new insurance products that don't have a large enough sample size to make an accurate forecast. Once the product has been sold for a while, this method will be replaced by one based on the number of claims filed by those who have actually purchased the insurance product.\",\n",
       " 'Expected value is the projected future value an investment or an asset will have after a certain amount of time.Expected value can help both insurance companies and policyholders select investments. If the expected value of an investment is too low, compared to the risk of making this investment, it may be viewed as a bad decision. However, if the risk is low enough, and the expected value high enough, then the particular investment may be viewed more favorably.',\n",

It can also refer to the statistics calculated using the ratio of losses made by the policyholder to the premium of their insurance policy.An insurance company monitors the experience or the losses experienced by a policyholder to assess the possibility of risks and claims the policyholder will make in the future. Using the experience rating, the insurance company identifies the necessary changes or modifications to the premium to better reflect the level of risk the policyholder represents. If the experience of the policyholder is interpreted to have higher risk compared to other similar policyholders, the insurance company may charge higher premium for this policyholder as a means to ensure claims or losses do not exceed premiums taken in.',\n",

Individual companies are rated according to the average rating (1.0) of their class in terms of past claims and accidents at work. If the company gets the same rating as the average or a lower one than it (1.0 or lower), they will be offered a low premium. If its rating is above average (1.1 or higher) because they have submitted a high volume of claims in the past or have numerous workplace accidents on their record, then the company will be charged a high premium.\",\n",

Insurance companies use it to adjust premium rates typically for workers' compensation and liability policies to reflect more accurately the amount of risk a policyholder actually represents. The assumption is that past losses would continue similarly into the future.Insurance companies regularly monitor the claims filed and paid out for their policies to determine what category of policyholders are more or less prone to filing claims and thereby more or less risky to insure. They then use the experience rating to adjust future premiums to better reflect the level of risk in a policy.\",\n",

The effective date is the day it is meant to go into effect or on the renewal date of the policy.The flat cancellation is treated differently than short rate or pro-rata cancellations and is the easiest way to end or terminate an insurance policy. Flat cancellations are much simpler than pro-rata and short rate cancellations because no money has changed hands, and there is no need to recalculate the insurance costs.',\n",
       " 'A flat commission is a fee an insurance company pays to an insurance agent every time they sell a policy for the company. In this case, the type of policy sold does not matter. As long as the insurance agent sells a policy, they receive the commission.Commissions are a way to incentivize insurance agents to sell policies. The more policies they sell, the more they are paid. Commissions may be paid in addition to a traditional salary or serve as an alternative to the latter.',\n",
       " \"A fleet policy is a type of commercial auto insurance that insures a group of motor vehicles, usually ranging from two to 500. The coverage may be the same for every vehicle, or it may vary, depending on the insurer's need. Just like regular auto insurance, it may range from basic to comprehensive coverage.Companies that own a large number of vehicles typically purchase a fleet policy. However, companies with a mini fleet (six or less) may also purchase it. A fleet policy usually covers all types of vehicles, including trucks, vans, and family fleets. With this policy, the insurance company generally undertakes to pay for repairs, medical expenses, and damages caused to third party in case the injury or harm is due to explosive, toxic, or inflammable goods. Coverage may also extend to providing for temporary rentals and roadside assistance.\",\n",
       " 'A flexible benefit plan is a benefit program that allows employees to choose from a range of benefits, such as life insurance, retirement plans, vacations, child care, and cash. Typically, the program requires a core set of benefits, but it gives employees the opportunity to allocate the remaining benefit dollars however they wish.Through a flexible benefits plan, employers promise to provide their workers with a specific amount as benefits. The workers can then decide how they want their benefit dollars allocated from the available options. Some or all the benefits offered may have tax advantages.',\n",
       " 'Flexible funding is a type of pooled investing in which a money manager has the ability to change the investments from asset class to asset class as they see fit. This differs from other types of funds in which only one asset class is invested in.Flexible funding can also refer to the process of creating a pre-tax spending account for health-related expenses that are not covered by insurance. These accounts can be exempt from income taxes; however, they have to be used only for specific types of expenses to be valid. Expenses related to dependent care, for example, would qualify.',\n",
       " \"A flexible premium annuity is a retirement plan that allows the insured to choose the mode of payment for their premiums and their retirement income. This flexibility allows annuitants to exempt themselves from paying taxes on their premium payments.These annuities are called flexible because the annuitant can choose how they pay their premium, whether it's monthly, quarterly, annually, or in a lump sum. Likewise, when the annuitant monetizes the policy after retirement, they can choose from monthly, quarterly, or annual disbursement.\",\n",
       " 'A flexible premium deferred annuity is a retirement plan that allows choice in the mode of payment and payout. It guarantees an annuitization that is not less than the total amount of payments, and the taxes are deferred until payout.When someone wants to buy this annuity, they have a choice between three payment schedules: a lump sum payment, a monthly payment, or a yearly payment. They also have a choice of payout schedules, which are, like the payment schedules, lump sum, monthly, or annual.',\n",

This program exempts some health expenditures from taxation.To acquire a flexible spending account, an employee must first enroll in the Federal Flexible Spending Account Program or their employer must have already adopted the program. This account is meant to result in savings on medications and other health expenses by avoiding the taxes on those products and services.\",\n",
       " 'A floater refers to an insurance policy that covers property that is easy to move. These policies typically provide additional coverage beyond the coverage already provided by normal insurance policies. In many cases, floater insurance covers various personal belongings such as jewelry, expensive stereo equipment, surgical equipment, agricultural equipment, etc.Many homeowners take out mortgage loans for purchasing a home. To protect their interests if the house experiences destruction or damage, the lenders require the homeowners to purchase homeowner’s insurance. This insurance policy combines various personal insurance protections such as:',\n",
       " 'A floater policy is insurance protection that covers movable property and other items moved from one place to another and not usually covered by standard policies. In other words, it is additional coverage from property that may not necessary remain at all times in the covered property.A floater policy insures the movable item against transportation perils as well as other perils that may put the insured item at risk at its destination.',\n",
       " 'Flood insurance is a type of property insurance that offers protection against losses caused by flooding or water overflow. As typical homeowners insurance does not cover this hazard, a separate policy must be purchased.In the United States, only a select amount of companies offer flood insurance because the amount of claimants far outweigh the number of people interested in this type of coverage; thus, private insurers view the likelihood of making a profit as slim. Some mortgage lenders, however, require flood insurance, especially for high value homes as well as those located in high risk areas. Nonetheless, the National Flood Insurance Program, initiated by the U.S. government, offers a flood insurance program for both private and public buildings while also encouraging citizens to support and comply with flood management regulations.',\n",
       " 'A flood zone is a designated area that has a certain degree of risk for floods. These zones are often near sources of water, such as rivers, oceans, or lakes.FEMA provides charts that identify flood zones. These charts are an important part of the underwriting process, since floods can often cause property damage that results in total loss of house or commercial buildings. As a result, those who own property in flood zones face some challenges when it comes to insuring it.',\n",
       " \"Force-placed insurance is an insurance policy placed by a lender onto a property in the event that the property owner's insurance has lapsed or been cancelled. Property owners are required to have sufficient insurance to protect their property so that the mortgage holder’s, or lender’s, interests are protected in case of damage to the property. The property is essentially collateral that serves as security to guarantee repayment of the loan. If a property owner allows his or her insurance to lapse, or has insurance deemed inadequate by the lender, the lender can buy forced-placed insurance at the homeowner’s expense.Force-placed insurance has garnered some media attention in recent years. This insurance is much more expensive than insurance that can be obtained by a property owner on the open market, and offers limited coverage. For example, personal property in the home and owner liability are not covered.\",\n",

It offers insurance to companies that export goods, which covers both financial and political risks.In 1961, 50 American insurance companies formed the FCIA. It was—and is—sponsored by the Export-Import Bank of the United States, the official export credit agency of the United States. It is in charge of providing insurance for exporting companies.',\n",
       " 'A foreign insurer is an insurance company that is located in one state, but which writes policies for clients in other states. While foreign insurers are very common in health insurance, many insurers in the United States are restricted to selling in a single state due to the concept of \"state lines.\"Insurance companies often become foreign insurers to access a larger market and acquire more clients. Insurers who try to operate as foreign insurers, however, face more challenges since they will have to compete with insurers in other states.',\n",
       " 'A forfeiture is the loss of a property without compensation in favor of one party to a contract when the other party defaults or fails to comply with its obligations. In terms of insurance, a forfeiture takes place when the policyholder defaults on the payment of premiums, which is also known as an insurance policy lapse. As a result, the policy is no longer in effect and the premiums already paid are forfeited by the insurer.A forfeiture occurs when one of the involved parties falls short of meeting their obligation in a contract. For example, in a life insurance policy, the insured is required to declare the truth about his past and present health conditions prior to entering in an insurance contract. If in any case the insured is found to have concealed a material fact, the insurance company may enact a forfeiture of the policy and all the premiums already paid. However, if the insurance contract has a non-forfeiture clause, the insured may still receive benefits, albeit a reduced or limited amount, or the insurer may issue a partial refund of the paid premiums.',\n",

It may occur due to some sort of breach of contract or failure to meet certain conditions as stipulated in the policy.The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) is a law that regulates employee benefits, including pension plans, and sets forth minimum standards to the various plans. Thus, according to ERISA, forfeiture of vested benefits happens when the beneficiary commits any of the following:',\n",

       " 'Fraud is the illegal act of deceiving, lying, or manipulating another party in the insurance industry. Both buyers and sellers can commit fraud. Buyers can commit insurance fraud by making false claims, lying about medical records, and other important details. Insurance sellers can commit fraud by selling illegitimate policies, not submitting premiums, and engaging in other deceptive practices. People found guilty of insurance fraud can face jail time and other legal consequences.The way that insurance is supposed to work is that insurance buyers are supposed to provide accurate information about themselves, buy policies from legitimate companies, and only make claims when they have legitimate reasons to do so. However, this does not always happen. For example, a car insurance policyholder may want a new car and decides to \"accidentally\" crash their car into a tree for the purposes of having a cause to file a claim so the insurance company would pay for a new car up to the policy limits. This is only one example, as there are various ways insurance fraud may be committed.',\n",

The former is when a claimant deliberately plans, invents, or creates a loss covered by the insurance policy, while the latter occurs when a claimant exaggerates a legitimate claim or gives false information to obtain bigger gains. Making fraudulent claims is a crime, no matter what the outcome may be. Because they make up a significant portion of the total claims filed, losses for insurers are estimated to be in the billions every year.',\n",

Second, there must be a reckless disregard to the truth of the statement. Third, there must be an intent on the part of the person to induce the other to enter into the contract believing that the statement is true.

If they have agreed on FOB destination, then it means that while the items are still on the ship, the seller is still the owner of these items and responsible for their safety. If they have agreed on FOB origin, the ownership is given to the buyer as well as liability for loss or damage.
