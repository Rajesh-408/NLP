      "Text content: Federal Employees Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) was established on August 29, 1954 to provide insurance coverage for civil service workers in the United States. Employees of federal units automatically get covered by this insurance unless they decline it. Federal employees are automatically covered by FEGLI's basic life insurance. They pay two-thirds of the premium, which is deducted from their paychecks, and the US government pays the remainder. Federal employees do not have to meet any additional requirements to qualify for coverage.  FEGLI provides three forms of coverage beyond the basic life insurance policy. If a federal employee chooses any of these, they pay the premium without any subsidies from the government. These coverage options have additional requirements, including the need to provide health documents.  Share this Term\n"

They pay two-thirds of the premium, which is deducted from their paychecks, and the US government pays the remainder. Federal employees do not have to meet any additional requirements to qualify for coverage.  FEGLI provides three forms of coverage beyond the basic life insurance policy. If a federal employee chooses any of these, they pay the premium without any subsidies from the government. These coverage options have additional requirements, including the need to provide health documents.  \\r\\n                     \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                         \\r\\n                             Advertisement \\r\\n\\r\\n                             \\r\\n                                 \\r\\n                                 \\r\\n                                     \\r\\n                                        googletag.cmd.push(function () {\\r\\n                                            googletag.display(\\'Termpage_Inread_2IP\\');\\r\\n                                            if (typeof (pubwise) != \\'undefined\\' && pubwise.enabled === true) {\\r\\n                                                pwpbjs.que.push(function () {\\r\\n                                                    pwRegisterLazyLoad(gptadslots[\\'Termpage_Inread_2IP\\'], 1, [50, 0, 50, 0], 0, 768, 2);\\r\\n                                                });\\r\\n                                            } else {\\r\\n                                                googletag.pubads().refresh([gptadslots[\\'Termpage_Inread_2IP\\']]);\\r\\n                                            }\\r\\n                                        });\\r\\n                                     \\r\\n                                 \\r\\n\\r\\n                             \\r\\n                         \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                     \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n     Share this Term \\r\\n     \\r\\n         \\r\\n         \\r\\n         \\r\\n     \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                     \\r\\n\\r\\n                         \\r\\n                             Related Terms \\r\\n\\r\\n                             \\r\\n                                     \\r\\n                                         \\r\\n                                                 Group Life Insurance \\r\\n                                                 Veteran\\'s Group Life Insurance \\r\\n                                                 Individual Life Insurance \\r\\n                                                 Federal Insurance Administration \\r\\n                                                 Federal Employers Liability Act \\r\\n                                         \\r\\n                                     \\r\\n                                     \\r\\n                                         \\r\\n                                                 Federal Insurance Contributions Act \\r\\n                                                 Servicemen\\'s Group Life Insurance \\r\\n                                                 Premium Only Plan \\r\\n                                                 Multiemployer Plan \\r\\n                                                 Multiple Employer Trust'"
